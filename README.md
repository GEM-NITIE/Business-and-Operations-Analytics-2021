Business analytics refers to the ways in which enterprises can use data to gain insights and make better Operation decisions. The ability to use data effectively to drive rapid, precise, and profitable decisions has been a critical strategic advantage for companies as diverse as Walmart, Google, Nike, Capital One, and Disney. For example, Capital One uses sophisticated analytic capabilities to match credit card offerings to customers and WalMart uses analytics to monitor and update its inventory in a way that allows it to serve its customers at an exceptionally low cost.

NITIE is proud to present the Global Online Certification Course on ‘Business and Operations Analytics’ in association with Prof. David Simchi-Levi (MIT, USA).

The course emphasizes that Business and Operations Analytics is not a theoretical discipline: these techniques are only interesting and important to the extent that they can be used to provide real insights and improve the speed, reliability, and quality of decisions.

We have three goals in this course. The first is to help you think critically about data and the analyses based on those data — whether conducted by you or someone else. The second is to enable you to identify opportunities for creating value using business analytics. The third is to help you estimate the value created using business analytics to address an opportunity.

With business analytics being an integral part of modern management, this course should provide you with the foundation to understand and apply analytical methods to drive value.
